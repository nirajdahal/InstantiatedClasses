ii> Instantiated Class

- Generally dont put methods where model has been set in a class. Try to make methods in separate class
- Overiding variable which instantiate same class doesnot remove first objected. Infact the varibale only holds
	address of that object . So overiding it will be no issue

	ex : List<PersonModel> people = new List<PersonModel>();
            string firstName;

            

            //varibale holds addresss to new house not the house itself
            do
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello what is your name");
                firstName = Console.ReadLine();
                if (firstName.ToLower() != "exit")
                {
                    PersonModel person = new PersonModel();
                    person.FirstName = firstName;
                    people.Add(person);
                    //At this point the person variable gets blown away so we 
                    //are able instantiate new persson model with same vairable
                }
                

            } while (firstName.ToLower() !="exit");

            foreach (PersonModel person in people)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(person.FirstName);
            }


- When we are passing object as an argument we are reffering to the same object that we are passing not the copy
    ex: public static void GreetPerson(PersonModel person)

* Prop Tip : In general, Instantiated Classes store data. Static Classes are for stateless processing. Generally in an 
application instantiated classes are used more than static classes.
